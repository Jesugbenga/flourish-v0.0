# About the Developer — Jesugbenga

## Background

I am a full‑stack mobile/web developer focused on building production apps with server‑validated backends. I design apps end‑to‑end: from UX and client code (Expo + TypeScript) through serverless business logic and production build pipelines. My work emphasizes secure auth, subscription enforcement, and predictable AI integration.

## Relevant Experience

I am an incoming Software Engineer at Microsoft and have previously interned at Microsoft, Amazon and Enbridge, where I worked on production‑scale systems, compliance infrastructure, and user‑facing platform improvements.

At Microsoft (Copilot AI Search):

- Built a custom date range picker using React, TypeScript, and Fluent UI to enable flexible AI search filtering.
- Replaced manual pagination with infinite scroll for a product serving 80M+ global users.
- Collaborated cross‑functionally with PMs and senior engineers to accelerate feature delivery by ~20%.

This experience strengthened my ability to build scalable, user‑focused frontend systems while maintaining performance and usability at massive scale — principles I applied directly when designing Flourish’s clean, responsive mobile UI.

At Amazon (AWS + GDPR Compliance Systems):

- Designed and deployed a deletion API using Java, Kotlin, S3, DynamoDB, SNS, and SQS to automate user data removal.
- Built a compliance‑driven data deletion pipeline aligned with GDPR standards.
- Reduced Severity‑2 incidents by ~85% through automation and backend reliability improvements.

This experience directly informed Flourish’s secure backend architecture: server‑side validation of subscription entitlements, webhook‑driven state synchronization, clean REST API design, and privacy‑conscious user data handling.

At Enbridge (Hydraulics & Knowledge Management):

- Performed performance analysis and automation using Power BI, SQL, and VBA to improve workflows and reporting.
- Built internal knowledge solutions and improved information accessibility across large organizations.

Selected full‑stack projects:

- **Showtrove** — Movie discovery with Next.js, MongoDB, Pinecone, LangChain, and OpenAI for conversational recommendations.
- **Looply** — React Native ride‑sharing prototype with geospatial driver‑matching and real‑time notifications (Firebase + Expo).
- **QVault LMS** — Django‑based course management deployed with Docker and automated Selenium tests.

These projects shaped my ability to integrate AI meaningfully into product workflows, architect scalable backend systems, design secure authentication and user management, and balance technical complexity with intuitive UX.

## Motivation for Participating in the Hackathon

I participated in this hackathon to challenge myself to build something meaningful under time constraints — not just technically impressive, but emotionally relevant.

Financial stress affects millions of families, yet most financial tools are built with spreadsheets in mind rather than people. I wanted to explore how AI could be used not just for automation, but for empowerment.

Hackathons create a unique environment where:

- Speed meets creativity
- Constraints drive innovation
- Ideas move from concept to execution rapidly

Flourish was built to test whether:

- AI can simplify financial decisions
- Subscription models can be secure and scalable from day one
- Fintech apps can feel warm instead of intimidating

This hackathon gave me the opportunity to prototype a production‑ready architecture while staying user‑focused.

More than anything, I wanted to build something that could realistically grow beyond the hackathon stage — something that could become a real product, used by real families.

Flourish is that vision in motion.
